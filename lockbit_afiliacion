Categories of targets to attack:

It is forbidden to attack the post-Soviet countries such as: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine and Estonia. This is due to the fact that most of our developers and partners were born and grew up in the Soviet Union, the former largest country in the world, but now we are located in the Netherlands.

It is allowed to steal data from any medical facilities without encryption, as it may be a medical secret and must be strictly protected in accordance with the law. If you can't pinpoint whether or not a particular medical organization can be attacked, contact the helpdesk.
It is very commendable to attack police stations and any other law enforcement agencies that are engaged in finding and arresting hackers, they do not appreciate our useful work as a pentest with postpaid and consider it a violation of the law, we should show them that a competent computer network setup is very important and write a fine for computer illiteracy.
It is allowed to attack government organizations, only with revenue.

Percentage rate of affiliate program is 20% of the ransom, if you think that this is too much and because of this you are working with another affiliate program or using your personal software, then you should not deny yourself the pleasure of working with us, just increase the amount of ransom by 20% and be happy.

You receive payments from companies to your personal wallets in any convenient currency and only then transfer the share to our affiliate program. However, for ransom amounts over $500 thousand, you give the attacked company 2 wallets for payment - one is yours, to which the company will transfer 80%, and the second is ours for 20%, thus we will be protected from scam on your part.

You personally communicate with the attacked companies and decide yourself how much money to take for your invaluable pentest work, which should surely be generously paid.

If you have any questions, doubts or complaints, you do not like something, please tell it to TOX support. If you are very shy, you can do it anonymously by creating a new one-time TOX. It is very important for us to know about all our strengths and weaknesses in order to constantly improve our service.

Every candidate to join our affiliate program should understand that we are constantly trying to be hacked and harmed in some way. This is why we pay a lot of attention to the candidates who join our partnership program. When joining, a lot of factors are taken into consideration, such as the reputation on the forums, the team composition, evidence of work with other affiliate programs, your wallet balance, the amount of previous payments and much more. You can also join our team by a guarantee of our partners, who are already active and time-tested.

After many years of experience, we concluded that the most effective way to test a candidate for accession is a deposit. When you join, you deposit 1 bitcoin in our wallet, in fact, this amount is an advance and will be used at your subsequent payments as payment for our 20% share. For example, the company paid you a ransom for decrypting 100 bitcoins, you have to transfer a share of 20 bitcoins to us, but thanks to the deposit you made when you joined, the amount of the share paid will be 19 bitcoins. This procedure is required only once, only when you join the affiliate program. The deposit weeds out insecure newbies, cops, FBI agents, journalists, white haters, web pentesters, competitors, and other small rodent pests. The deposit amount may be reduced or not required at all, depending on what reputation you have and what information you can provide about yourself. For those who are afraid to trust us with their money and think that we are scammers, it is possible to carry out this procedure through a guarantor, any reputable forum, in this case, you make a deposit on the balance of the forum, where we describe the conditions of the deposit, which are very simple, for example, if you can not earn 5 bitcoins in a month, then your deposit goes to us.

Please, be understanding with such a careful attitude to your candidacy, because you personally would not be very pleased if your newly encrypted company was decrypted for free by the FBI thanks to some person who easily gained access to the panel and made a masterful hack of our servers using zero-day vulnerabilities.

Recommended, but not required, application form when joining:

1) Links to your profiles on various hacker forums - the older your account, the better.
2) Describe your experience with other affiliate programs, preferably with some evidence, such as screenshots and transactions that show your payouts.
3) Show your balance in cryptocurrency at the moment.
4) Explain the reasons why you left another affiliate program and want to work with us.
5) Tell about the current accesses you have and are ready to attack immediately after joining us. It is recommended to prove yourself immediately after joining - the sooner you get the first payment, the less doubt will be cast on your identity.
6) It is desirable to have already downloaded information for the blog from the intended target for the attack and provide evidence of the existence of this information, such as screenshots, file tree or access to these files.
7) Ask your friends or acquaintances who already work with us to vouch for you.
8) Request a bitcoin or monero wallet to make a deposit, in case you are confident in your abilities and ready to earn millions of dollars with us.
